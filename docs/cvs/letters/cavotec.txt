Hello, I am writing to you regarding the vacant
"SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER" in Cavotec's site in
Stjørdal kommune.

My apologies for not writing in Norwegian this presentation
letter. My Norwegian is not so good and I haven't used
it in a few months. But I am confident I could improve that
in a short time. In my previous job I travelled often to
Norway (including Sør-Trøndelag) and I tried to learn
Norwegian with both online and regular courses.

I am not sure if you are willing take into consideration
a candidate currently not living in Norway. Of course I'd
be able to relocate in a reasonable time scope.

I am currently employed at the Spanish branch of the Swiss
ERNI consulting firm (erni.ch), and I provide my services at
the Hewlett-Packard R+D site in Barcelona, a very large site
with some hundreds of engineers. My job consists in developing
and maintaing a core C++ multiplatform API that is used by
several external applications to communicate with the printers
through web services.

I am currently learning and putting into practice (basically
with hobby projects) technologies like rPI and other
embedded devices and environments.

In my previous job I worked with plenty of embedded devices
that used mostly linux as OS. I also developed plenty of
device drivers and real-time software that controlled them.

I also have plenty of experience deploying systems in 
outdoor environments, something which was part of my
duties in my previous job.

One of my most significant achievements was developing and
deploying a prototype that won a project for the Oslo ring
bompenge (statens vegvesen), in 2007.

I do have an online professional profile both in linkedIn and
and stackoverflow, I can provide links if necessary.
